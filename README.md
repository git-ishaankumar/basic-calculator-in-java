### Basic Calculator in Java
[![YouTube Demonstration](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube_Demonstration-YouTube-red)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEClsw5D5nr9-fxn-WHqPmw)<br>
This is my first command-line application I made in Java. It is a basic 4 function calculator, capable of computing integers and floating point numbers.

+ Use the arithmetic operators on the keyboard to choose an operator (+, -, *, /)
+ Invalid useage of either numbers or operators will result in a restart in the calculator, as invalid values cannot be passed

### Java
To run this project, JDK must be installed. [Download JDK here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

1. Download JDK
2. Run the file
3. Start the installation process
   - Choose Java location on your computer
   - Let it install
4. In the `src` folder, open the `Main.java` file with Java

### Note
If you attempt to add, subtract, multiply, or divide a very large number, you might see the letter `E` in the answer. The `E` refers to the power of ten. The preceding number gets multiplied.
